# DataTalks Data Engineering Course 🚀  

This repository contains my progress in the **DataTalks Data Engineering Course**. I'll be documenting my learnings, sharing homework solutions, and applying concepts to real-world scenarios.  

## 📌 Course Overview  
The course covers various topics essential for Data Engineering, including:  
- **Docker & Containers** ✅ *(Completed - Check Homework Below)*
- Data Warehousing  
- Data Lake & Lakehouse  
- Workflow Orchestration  
- Batch & Streaming Processing  
- Cloud & Infrastructure  
- And more...  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
Each module has its own folder containing:  
- 📖 **Notes** – Key takeaways from the module  
- 💻 **Code** – Relevant scripts and implementations  
- 🏠 **Homework** – My solutions for each assignment  


## ✅ Completed Modules
